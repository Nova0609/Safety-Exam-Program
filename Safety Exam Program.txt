Safety Exam Program
    1. Create a local Website that manages a database of Truck Drivers and Contractors Safety Information through an HTML table

    Back-End
        Data Table
            1. Must have a Data Table; designate entries as either Truck Driver or Contrator

            3. If possible automate the Date Exam Expires to auto fill from the Date Exam Taken for 1 year after the Taken Date.

            4. Have a counter for how many times the person has taken the Exam

            5. Retain all data records for 3 years, delete records over 3 years old based on Exam Expiriation Date


    Front-End
        1. Must beable to add new records to table. [See Below for Entry Details]

        2. Must beable to query records from a search condition:
            [Driver/Contrator Name, Truck/Contractor Company Name, Exam Date Taken, Exam Date Expiration, Level of Exam Taken, Exam Administrator]

        3. After searching for Driver/Contrator display message if they are:
            EXPIRED in RED
            ABOUT TO EXPIRE [within a week or month] in YELLOW
            NOT EXPIRED in GREEN

        4. Display a Clear Warning if Person is NOT ALLOWED inside the plant.

        5. Must beable to Update Exisiting Entries if information changes.
            [employment to different Company, Name Change, Not Allowed Into Plant, etc...]

        6. Have a warning box for updating entries.

    Home Page
        1. Search Box with a simple tip for what to search for.
             Search Box could have a filter option for results, perhaps a drop-down menu with searchable criteria. For example to search for a Contractor named Mike Smith
             select Contractor from the Drop-Down menu and type in Mike Smith. Could look like the following:
             |Drop-Down Menu|Search Box...                |
             ----------------example----------------------
             |Contractor    |Mike Smith                   |

        2.Add New Entry Button

        3. Import Data Button [This will import 2 CSV files (1 for Truck Drivers and 1 for Contractors) to put the data into the HTML Table]
                                Note:This Import Button will most likely only be used for the initial ingest of data. This button can be displayed on the "table.html"
                                which isn't seen by the user on the Front-End. A Readme file can be included with this program, Instructing the user to open "table.html"
                                and go through the Import process.

        4. [Nice to Have]: An Import option for the Safety Exam in case the Exam changes in the future. Maybe stored in "docs.html"

        5. [Nice to Have]: A Copy of the Safety Exam to Print Out. Maybe this can be under a "Docs" Tab or Menu on the Home Page.

        6. [Nice to Have]: An option to Physically Print select or all Records for Auditing Purposes.
